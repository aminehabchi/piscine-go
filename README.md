# Piscine Go

Welcome to the **Piscine Go** repository! This project is dedicated to my journey of learning the Go programming language (also known as Golang).

## About This Repository

This repository contains my exercises, notes, and experiments as I dive into learning Go. It follows a structured approach, inspired by the "Piscine" style of intensive, hands-on learning.

> **Note:**  
> All of these exercises were completed during a one-month intensive program at **Zone01 Oujda** in **01 2024**.

## What Iâ€™m Learning

Throughout this repository, I cover a variety of fundamental and advanced topics in Go, including but not limited to:

- **Go Basics**: Syntax, variables, data types, constants, and operators.
- **Control Structures**: If statements, loops, and switch cases.
- **Functions**: Definition, parameters, returning values, and recursion.
- **Arrays, Slices, and Maps**: Collection types and how to manipulate them.
- **Structs and Methods**: Custom data types and associated behaviors.
- **Pointers**: Understanding references and memory management in Go.
- **Error Handling**: Idiomatic error management and custom errors.
- **Packages and Modules**: Organizing and reusing code.
- **Standard Library**: Utilizing Goâ€™s built-in packages for tasks like I/O, formatting, etc.
- **Testing**: Writing and running tests in Go.


## Why Go?

- Go is known for its simplicity, performance, and strong support for concurrency.
- It is widely used for building scalable and efficient software, especially in backend systems and cloud infrastructure.
